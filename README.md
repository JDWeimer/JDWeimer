# 💻 James Weimer's IT & Cybersecurity Project Portfolio 🔐

I'm passionate about IT and cybersecurity, and love tackling complex challenges through hands-on projects and active problem solving. From cloud systems and IT management, to vulnerability management and threat hunting/detection, to security operations and software development, these projects allow me to dive deep into the ever-evolving technology landscape. Please feel free to check them out and see the work I’ve put into setting up, managing, developing, and enhancing information technology and security operations/processes!
